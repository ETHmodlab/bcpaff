8 # Generating the paths connecting (3,-3) and (3,-1) CPs
-5 # Modify or print detail or export paths, or plot property along a path
8 # Only retain bond paths (and corresponding CPs) connecting two specific molecular fragments while remove all other bond paths and BCPs
1-32 # atoms belonging to first fragment
33-20000 # atoms belonging to second fragment
y # remove corresponding BCPs
4 # Save points of all paths to paths.txt in current folder

# OUTPUTS
# CPProp.txt → real-space values of CPs
# CP.txt → coordinates of CPs (might already be contained in CPProp.txt)
# paths.txt → path connectivity
